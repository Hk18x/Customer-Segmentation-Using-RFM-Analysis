# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-Analysis
(Tech Used - Python, Machine Learning, Power BI)

RFM segmentation is a powerful marketing analysis method that involves analyzing customer
behavior based on three key factors: recency, frequency, and monetary value. This approach
enables businesses to target specific clusters of customers with tailored communications, leading to
higher response rates, increased loyalty, and enhanced customer lifetime value

1- Recency

This factor measures how recently a customer has interacted or transacted with a
brand. A recent interaction indicates a higher likelihood of responsiveness to brand
communications.

2- Frequency

Frequency assesses how often a customer engages with a brand within a specific
period. Customers with frequent activities are typically more engaged and loyal,
while one-time-only customers represent a distinct category.

3- Monetary

Monetary value reflects the amount a customer spends with the brand during a
particular period. It's important to differentiate treatment for big spenders from
customers who spend less, and analyzing monetary divided by frequency provides
the average purchase amount for segmentation.
